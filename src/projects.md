### Buttercup Password Manager

Buttercup is a free and cross-platform password manager application that makes it easy to secure your digital credentials and secrets so that they're both safe and accessible. The Buttercup suite includes a desktop application, browser extension and mobile app.

The core is Typescript/JavaScript, built for NodeJS and the browser. The desktop application is built on Electron and the mobile app on React Native. The browser extension is built using a complex Webpack build pipeline that outputs bundles compatible with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

Check out the [website](https://buttercup.pw) or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/buttercup). Buttercup also has a presence on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/buttercup_pw) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bcup/). Secure communications should be undertaken via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/bcup).

_I'm the creator of Buttercup, and have built it from the ground up with a friend and colleague._
