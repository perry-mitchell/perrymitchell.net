Today we released the [first version](https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) of our cross-platform password manager, Buttercup, as an alpha release. A colleague and myself have been developing the application for many months now, and today marks an amazing achievement for us.

Buttercup is our take on what a credentials manager should be: a secure and functional application that provides a high level of accessibility (to the credentials) across every mainstream platform. The best part, in our opinion, is that it's free and open-source - something that our target competitors fail at.

We wrote Buttercup solely in JavaScript, using NodeJS with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) to generate the operating-system specific executables and installers.

Buttercup was born of dissatisfaction of the current password managers, which we feel suffer from one or more of the following issues:
 * They're not free
 * They're not open source
 * They lack cross platform applications
 * Their OS-specific clients lack consistency and/or quality
 * They lack decent support for interacting with remote archives
 * They provide no support for overwriting changes in a remote archive

The exact purpose of Buttercup is to address each and every one of these points - We wanted a password manager that we would want to use.

There's a lot of work to be done: We have huge plans for browser extensions, mobile applications and archive hosting solutions. We really appreciate any and all feedback, especially at this very early stage in Buttercup's development.
