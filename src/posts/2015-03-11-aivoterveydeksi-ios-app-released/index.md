After a full year of coding, tweaking and testing, I've released Muistiliitto's brain health application "[Aivoterveydeksi!](http://perrymitchell.net/portfolio/aivoterveydeksi/)" in the iOS app store. The app discusses many important matters regarding memory and brain health, memory disease, and what to do if you're concerned for yourself or someone else with regards to memory diseases. There are also games, a blog, and an activity + progress tracking section to encourage users to continue training their brain.

The app is in Finnish, but there are plans to release both Swedish and English versions in the not-so-distant future. It's also **free**, so why not download it and give it a try?

The application was made available for "brain week" - check it out on [Muistiliitto's site](http://www.muistiliitto.fi/fi/muisti-ja-muistisairaudet/aivoterveys/aivoterveydeksi/).
