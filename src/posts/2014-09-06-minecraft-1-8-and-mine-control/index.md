Mojang have released version 1.8 of Minecraft, which adds a vast array of efficiency improvements and features.

Unfortunately for users of my iOS app, Mine Control, some commands (like the **give** command) no longer work as they originally did. This means that certain features of the app **may not work correctly or at all** on 1.8 servers.

I apologise that I did not get the chance to address this sooner, though I will be making a patch for this very soon. At this stage, however, I may drop support for servers earlier than 1.7 - This would mean a simpler item database and command usage, and so I advise any users that still run pre-1.7 servers to upgrade sooner rather than later.

Due to iOS 8 being forcibly tested now in App reviews, the 2.1.2 release has been canned. 2.2 will be the next stable release, which will **only support Minecraft 1.7 and later**.
