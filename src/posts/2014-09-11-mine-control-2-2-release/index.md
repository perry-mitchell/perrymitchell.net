The 2.2 release of Mine Control is pending review - This release brings a few new updates:

*   Fixed support for the new Minecraft command system
*   Server editing
*   iOS 8 support (iPhone 6 and 6+)
*   Updated items list (Minecraft 1.8)

As of this release, versions of Minecraft earlier than 1.7 are not longer supported. I urge all users of my app to update their servers, or avoid downloading the 2.2 update.
