I'm a web & applications developer from Australia - living in Finland: writing software and pouring money into my homelab. I love everything JavaScript, have a passion for architecting large systems and love publishing open source software.

To really get a good idea of what I like working with, you should head over to my [GitHub](https://github.com/perry-mitchell). If you'd like to chat please catch me on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/perrymitchell). If you have support-related enquiries please leave an issue on the appropriate GitHub project.

I'm also on <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@perry_mitchell">Mastodon</a>, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/perry_mitchell) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/perry-james-mitchell).

I built [Buttercup Password Manager](https://buttercup.pw), and actively contribute to it.
